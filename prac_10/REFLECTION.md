## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

Estimates weren't very accurate, as some tasks were more complex than others, and you don't know how complex they are until you have done them.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

My estimate accuracy did not noticeably change throughout the course, as it was never very accurate to begin with.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

I learnt that guessing how loong something takes neither adds nor takes away from the learning experience.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

Code reviews gave me hints about what I could try differently. Different perspectives allow for greater understanding.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?
