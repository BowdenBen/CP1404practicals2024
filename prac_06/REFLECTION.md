# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

I am writing more pseudocode to better plan for my program structure.

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

I have to try and spend more time coding to get more comfortable with it, however this will be hard with semester finals approaching.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I'm writing cleaner code, and adhering to the DRY principle better.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

Not much, just devote more time for increasing the level of comfort with python.

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

None, so far. While I'm sure it's not practical, the rigidity of the subject sometimes removes the focus of coding.
