## The tenants of Clean code

- Readability: Code should be easy to read and understand. Using consistent naming conventions, appropriate whitespace, and simple structures make the code easier to follow. For example, prefer lower_case_with_underscores for variable and function names in Python​​​.


- Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): Each function or method should perform a single, clear task. Avoid mixing unrelated operations in a single function, which allows for easier debugging and reusability​​​.


- Consistent Naming: Use descriptive and unambiguous names. Variables, functions, and classes should have names that describe their purpose. Avoid using generic names like x, temp, or d when possible​​.


- Keep It Simple and Direct: Avoid complex and convoluted logic. Clear, direct solutions are easier to understand and maintain. Simplify expressions, use helper functions, and eliminate redundant code where possible​​.


- Minimize Dependencies: Aim to write modular code, where functions and classes can operate independently when possible. This reduces the coupling between different parts of the code and enhances reusability​​.


- Use Exceptions Thoughtfully: Instead of relying on conditions everywhere, use try-except blocks to handle errors gracefully. Handle exceptions only where necessary and avoid using them for regular flow control​​.


- Document and Comment Sparingly: Use comments to clarify complex logic or decisions, but avoid over-commenting. Code should be self-explanatory where possible, so focus on making the code clear rather than explaining unclear code through comments​​.


- Optimize for Performance When Needed: Use efficient data structures and algorithms where appropriate, but avoid premature optimization. Focus first on clarity and functionality, and then optimize any performance bottlenecks if they arise​​.


- Follow PEP 8 Guidelines: Python’s PEP 8 style guide is the standard for Python code style. This includes recommendations on indentation, line length, imports, and more, helping maintain consistency across Python projects​.


- Test Thoroughly: Regular testing helps catch bugs early and ensures that the code performs as expected. Write tests for each function, ideally covering edge cases, to validate correctness​​.
